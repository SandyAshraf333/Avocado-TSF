ðŸ¥‘ Avocado Time Series Forecasting (TSF)
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting avocado prices (or sales) over time using time series analysis techniques and machine learning models. The goal is to build an accurate and interpretable model to predict future values based on historical avocado data.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used contains historical avocado sales and pricing data, including:

Date of sale

Region

Average price

Type (organic/conventional)

Total volume sold

ðŸ§ª Features
ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify seasonality, trends, and outliers in avocado price and sales data.

ðŸ¤– Forecasting Models:

ARIMA

Facebook Prophet

LSTM (optional, deep learning)

ðŸ“‰ Performance Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE

ðŸ“¦ Modular and clean code structure for reusability
